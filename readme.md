# jstruct

![Builds](https://github.com/xtelligent/jstruct/workflows/npmpublish.yml/badge.svg)

When dealing with JSON over HTTP, you design and encounter some document structures that
can be unwieldy. Yes, there are great validators for structure, and there are tools like
`Swagger`. However, nothing makes it easy to fluently create a structure that supports
instantiation, mutated copies, and validation. 

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install @xtelligent/jstruct
